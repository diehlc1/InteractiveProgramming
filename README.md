# InteractiveProgramming
This is the base repo for the interactive programming project for Software Design, Spring 2016 at Olin College. To run make sure that all of the needed files and libraries are downloaded and imported. Then simply run the file FinalMap.py. When the window opens click on the slider bar and more the mouse to interact.
